description: |
  MinerU (https://github.com/opendatalab/mineru) is a document parsing engine that converts complex PDFs into structured, machine-readable formats such as Markdown and JSON.
  It was originally developed during the pre-training of InternLM and is particularly strong at handling formulas, symbols, and structured content commonly found in scientific literature.

  This inference backend image is built on top of the official MinerU Dockerfile:
  https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU/blob/master/docker/global/Dockerfile

  The backend image includes a built-in model, so the model selected on the Deployments page may be ignored.

  The model name must be set to: mineru
health_check_path: /v1/models
